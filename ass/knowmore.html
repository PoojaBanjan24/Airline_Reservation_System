                <p class="es">As a child, travelling alone can be an exciting experience but as a parent/guardian please be assured your child will be taken care of. 
                ISHUJA accepts unaccompanied minors, that is, children above the age of five (5) and below the age of twelve (12) upon payment of an additional fee as mentioned in the Table of Fees and Charges per Sector.
                For ease of flying under the “Flying Solo Service”, we have certain requirements for which our customers should follow these steps:</p> 
        </ul>
        <li class="se">At Departure:

            Please contact our reservation counter at the airport at least two (2) hours prior to departure.
            As a parent/guardian, you will be required to fill a form (click here to download the form). This form sets out the details of the parent/guardian receiving the child at the arrival airport. A copy of the signed form will be handed over to you.
            Please carry a valid photo-ID and proof of age for the unaccompanied minor at the time of check-in.
            An ISHUJA team member will take the child to the aircraft where our cabin crew will then look after them.
            We request the parent/guardian to remain at the airport until the flight has departed.
            </li>   
        <li class="se">On Board:

                During the flight our cabin crew will keep an eye on the child and will ensure they have everything they need.
                A meal and a beverage is included in our Flying Solo Service.  Guardian/ Parent should mention if the child is allergic to any particular food or beverage in the unaccompanied minor form.
                To ensure a comfortable flight, you are requested to pack necessary medication and warm clothing. Note: Please inform us if the child needs to be given any particular medication during the duration of the flight.
                Packing a favorite toy or a game in their hand baggage makes their journey enjoyable.</li>
